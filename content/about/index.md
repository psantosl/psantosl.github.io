I founded [Plastic SCM](https://www.plasticscm.com), a version control system used by game studios, Fortune 500 companies, and research organizations worldwide, which was [acquired by Unity Technologies in 2020](https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/unity-adquiere-empresa-espanola-codice-software-a-su-producto-estrella-plastic-scm-alternativa-a-git). I also built [SemanticMerge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Du-rbK_7ASE&t=69s) (site no longer available, but you can watch a video), the first merge tool that actually understood code structure, and gmaster, a Git Desktop tool that solved [merges of refactored code across files](https://youtu.be/n5cnpyjRerQ?si=xFheAsLXJXgYOv7D).

I've spent 20+ years in version control and developer tools. Most recently, I worked as a version control expert at Activision. I advise [Diversion](https://www.diversion.dev) (a next-gen version control platform) and [Inspiration-Q](https://www.inspiration-q.com) (quantum-inspired optimization).

I write about building software products, developer tools, and the occasional side quest.
