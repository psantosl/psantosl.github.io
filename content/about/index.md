I founded [Plastic SCM](https://www.plasticscm.com), a version control system used by game studios, Fortune 500 companies, and research organizations, which was [acquired by Unity Technologies in 2020](https://www.xataka.com/empresas-y-economia/unity-adquiere-empresa-espanola-codice-software-a-su-producto-estrella-plastic-scm-alternativa-a-git). I also built [SemanticMerge](https://semanticmerge.com), the first merge tool that actually understood code structure.

I've spent 20+ years in version control and developer tools. I spent two years as a version control expert at Activision, and I advise [Diversion](https://www.diversion.dev) (a next-gen version control platform) and Inspiration-Q (quantum-inspired optimization).

I also build products. [gitmergetool.com](https://gitmergetool.com) is a browser-based merge tool for GitHub. [laps.racing](https://laps.racing) is Strava for motorsport. [rows.life](https://rows.life) is a time tracker and life journal born from my 16-year habit of logging every hour. [papervault.io](https://papervault.io) brings version control to the Word documents professionals email back and forth.

I write about building software products, developer tools, and the occasional side quest.
